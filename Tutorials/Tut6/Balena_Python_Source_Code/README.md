## A Simple Server with Python Flask

This is a simple skeleton Flask server project that works on any of the devices supported by [balena][balena-link].

This project simply serves up `"Hello World! From Bhekanani Cele & Kwena Komape #2021"` on port `:80` of your balena device.

In your browser you should be able to open the device URL and see the message "Hello World! From Bhekanani Cele & Kwena Komape #2021".
